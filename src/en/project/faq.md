:::details Sign Up Conditions

- You can join with zero-based knowledge, regardless of grade, major and school, current students and graduates can sign up to study.
- It is of course better if you have basic knowledge of computers or circuits, but it is not mandatory, because relevant learning content will also be arranged in the preliminary and B stage of "One Student One Chip".
- TAs guides everyone at key points, but does not teach step by step.For example, the handouts tell everyone to master Verilog and recommend tutorials, but TAs do not arrange classroom teaching because there are already many textbooks and online courses in this area.

**Can non-school students participate?**

- You can participate in the learning process, but it is not free of charge (existing funds can only be used to support domestic students).
- Students who have just graduated or have graduated but are about to enroll are considered current students (for example, when school starts in September, or before graduation on August 31).

**Is there a fee to participate?**

- "One Student One Chip" is a non-profit learning project. Registration and learning are free, but currently only supports free tape-out for school students. For details, please refer to the relevant entries.

**After participating in "One Student One Chip", can I also participate in other competitions?**

- "One Student One Chip" focuses on talent cultivation and does not conflict with any competition. The code written by everyone participating in "One Student One Chip" can be used to participate in competitions.If you win the award, we very much hope that you can cite "One Student One Chip" in your acknowledgment to expand the influence of "One Student One Chip" and attract more sponsorships, thereby supporting more students to tape-out.

**Is it possible to form a team to participate?**

- No, "One Student One Chip" is a training program. We hope that everyone can get the maximum training.
- After everyone completes the training and enters the community, or the `Sig group` and the `Open Source IP` project, you can naturally form a team with other students.

**Can I participate just by signing up?Or do I need to interview and screen?**

- You can participate at any time but there is a preliminary stage that allows everyone to figure out whether they really want to participate in One Student One Chip.

**Can students currently studying in foreign universities finally be able to tap-out?**

- Free tap-out for foreign students is not supported.Funding requirements are subject to restrictions.

**Can I pay for tape-out?**

- The details of paid tape-out have not yet been determined and will be announced eventually.

**If I haven’t finished this session, can I still participate in the next session?**

- Yes.

**Can I participate in the new session if I participated in the previous?**

- Yes.

**Can high school students participate?**

- Can try.But the suggestion is still to focus on learning.

:::details Sign up Process

- Please sign up according to the notes in [official website](/).

**Is there a deadline for sign up?**

- No, anytime.

**How to fill in the form for the instructor?**

- Can be blank.

**What should I write on my resume?**

- You can write information about courses, projects, etc, just like a job resume.

**Will the submitted resume be made public?**

- Your resume will not be made public, but your learning records and submitted code will be, but you can hide information you don’t want to make public, such as your name.

**How can I check if I have been admitted after sign up?**

- After filling out the questionnaire, you can start preliminary. After preliminary, fill out a preliminary defense application form. After that, a TA will contact you about the defense. For details, please refer to the learning process on the official website.
  :::

:::details Tape-out indicators

- If you reach the target and pass the defense, you can enter the tape-out, and we will try our best to arrange the latest batch of shuttle (involving MPW).
- Originality and improvement, the code is written by yourself, and participation in "One Student One Chip" has greatly improved (or community service)
- The tape-out only supports current students (submit before 8.31 for fresh graduates). Those who have graduated can pay for the tape-out (depending on the area, specific policies are to be determined).
- Give back to the community: Obtain tape-out through defense, and it is recommended to participate in community services (TA and "One Student One Chip" open source projects, etc).

**Is it possible to tape-out if it meets the tape-out standards?**

- Uncertain.Meeting the tape-out standards is the most basic requirement, and it needs to be reviewed and approved before tape-out is possible.
- In extreme cases, if the number of core that meet the tape-out standards is significantly higher than expected, it is planned to select the best core for tape-out after review.
- Regarding tape-out quotas, shuttle, etc, the project team promises "Best effort", but does not make a deterministic guarantee (it does not seem to be a big problem at the moment).

**Is it possible to improve the indicator?**

- Yes, we encourage students to sprint for higher targets.

**Is it possible to lower the indicator?**

- The tape-out indicator will not be reduced, and those who have not reached the tape-out indicator will not be able to enter the tape-out.

**Can it be submitted based on modifications to existing open source chip projects?**

- No, "One Student One Chip" is a learning project, and every line of code must be written by yourself.

**What are the quotas for participating in "One Student One Chip" and the quotas for tape-out?**

- There is currently no limit to the number of people who can participate in the "One Student One Chip" and students can learn as they go.In extreme cases, due to the size of the support team, we will make a decision based on comprehensive consideration based on the number of applicants and the status of the TA team.

**Is it ready for tape-out after the front-end is completed in six months?**

- See if the content of A stage is completed.It’s not about the length of time.
  :::

:::details Learning Process

- Mainly remote participation, some students will be invited to be on-site TA (can sign up).
- Weekly meetings to review progress and answer questions.
- Students need to record their learning process every `1 to 3` days so that we can guide and track their work process.
- Everyone needs to keep `Git commit`, and `Git log` is also an important basis for us to track everyone's learning process.

**While participating in "One Student One Chip", can I pause for a while and then continue?**

- Yes, you can adjust your plan appropriately based on your own knowledge base and time, but you need to declare and ask for leave in advance.

**Is it necessary to report weekly and update work records every 1 to 3 days?**

- For students who have better abilities and can achieve higher targets, they can make arrangements by themselves;
- For students who are weak and need to improve, please proceed according to the above rhythm
- In addition, `Git log` is needed no matter which students.

**What is the format of the weekly meetings?Need to spend time preparing PPT?**

- Just prepare briefly, mainly prepare progress records.

**What should I do if I can’t keep up with my studies?**

- The `Schedule` provided by One Student One Chip only provides a reference time period.Everyone can advance step by step based on their basic abilities and available time.We will still arrange guidance.

**答疑可以指导哪些问题？**

- 会指明方向，告诉大家思路。比如告诉大家需要用`Git`，但是不会教`Git`；
- 希望大家先主动探索，不到万不得已情况（`Bug`卡了一礼拜没进展），不会指导太细；
- 很多材料课本上和网上都有，大家只要花一些时间去搜索和实践，是可以自己解决的；
- 主动探索和动手实践的能力，才是整个“一生一芯”计划培养的核心。

**每周大概投入多少时间？**

- 很难一概而论，每个人的基础是不同的。可以先参加预学习尝试一下。

**如果被误判作弊怎么办？**

- 判断是否作弊的依据是大家日常提交的工作记录，以及`Git log`；
- 如果误判，可向项目组提起申诉，我们会组织二轮专家评审来确定。

**预学习答辩是什么形式？**

- 简单聊一聊，主要是了解大家预学习阶段的完成情况以及对项目的热情度等。

**预学习时间最长限制是多少？**

- 学习时间没有限制。只是流片有时间节点。

**推荐教程是英文还是中文？**

- 一般是英文。
  :::

:::details 芯片实现

- 不要求一定使用`Chisel`，大家可以自己选定语言；但建议有`Verilog`基础的同学选用`Chisel`；
- 项目组会主要就`Chisel`和`Verilog`的问题给大家答疑；
- 我们在参考资料里给大家推荐了`Chisel`的学习资料；
- `VHDL`暂时还不支持，多语言的话，`SoC`集成的时候也会复杂一些。

**“一生一芯” 一定要基于 RISC-V？**

- 是的，`RV64`。

**是否可以加 Cache？**

- 可以，并且流片指标中需要。但有规格限制，讲义中会跟大家讲。

**SoC后端是统一的交给某个同学做还是每个人都能做？**

- 后端物理设计相关的工作是线下开展，感兴趣的同学可以联系助教。

**一人设计一个芯片是从前端到后端吗？**

- 主要是前端，后端涉及到 license，目前无法对每个同学都开放。
  :::

:::details 其他杂项

- 有的。B站上有[官方视频号](https://space.bilibili.com/2107852263)。

**Chisel之父要如何加？**

- 这是[GitHub主页](https://github.com/sequencer)。

**请问“敬畏芯片”具体是指什么？**

- 希望大家抱着认真严谨负责的态度来对待项目。

**往届代码在哪里看？**

- 不建议同学们看往届代码。
